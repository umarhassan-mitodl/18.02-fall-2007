The course occasionally relies on a series of specially written interactive math applets ("mathlets"), which let you visualize and experiment with various concepts seen in lecture.

These applets were developed as part of the d'Arbeloff Interactive Mathematics Project (d'A I M P). They were designed and developed in collaboration with Jean-Michel Claus.
